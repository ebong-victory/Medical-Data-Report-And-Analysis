# Medical-Data-Report-And-Analysis
This project focuses on analysing a medecial data set from Kaggle to evaluate the current realities of the data.
I used Power BI to analyse this data and build a suitable dashboard. The dashboard answers some pertinet questions like age demography ansd the average age of the patients surveyed, average blood pressure of patients per age age group, smoking status of surveyed patients, average BMI, blood pressure and glucose level of the patients surveyed. 

With this information and dashboards, medical personnel can better understand the current condition of their patients and plan adequately on how to treat and care for them. This analysis also unravel hidden causes and conditions which if left unchecked could worsen the situation of surveyed patients.

The results presented by this analysis will also be helpful in guiding the medical adminstration on what to prioritise when purchasing the necessary equipement and medicine for the medical center. 

Finally the results of this analysis can serve as the base model for predictive analysis and forcasting on the medical trajectory of current and future patients. It also hints to possible illness trajectory and spells out what conditions are high risk factors for the illnesses recorded in the survey.
